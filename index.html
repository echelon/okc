				<h2>Hi, I'm Brandon</h2>
				<p>Thanks for visiting my profile.</p>
				<p>I'm going to be keeping busy this summer with science
				projects, trips, attempting trying to launch a lasing 
				business, <em>et cetera</em>.</p>

				<p>I probably won't be able to to browse through profiles 
				and, causality as it is, likely won't initiate 
				conversation.</p>
				
				<p><small><em>(It's not at all that 
				I'm shy! No, it couldn't be that at all...)</em></small></p>
				
				<p>If you like my profile, <strong>please send me a friendly 
				message!</strong> I promise I won't bite. <em>(I'm not one of 
				those creepy internet people...)</em></p>
